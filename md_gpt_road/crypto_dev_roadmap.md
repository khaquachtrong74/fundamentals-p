## 🧑‍💻 Stage 2: Learn Coding for Crypto Tools

### 🎯 Goal: Use Python to build useful crypto apps or bots

- [ ] Learn Python basics (if you haven't)
- [ ] Learn how to use APIs (`requests`, `json`)
- [ ] Learn to read/write files, use `yaml` or `json`
- [ ] Learn how to use `gTTS`, `matplotlib`, etc.

📚 Resources:

## ⚙️ Stage 3: Build Projects (Start Simple, Grow Fast)

### 🎯 Goal: Build real tools for the crypto space

- [ ] 🔁 Crypto news summarizer bot (you're doing this now!)
- [ ] 📈 Build a dashboard that tracks coin prices (use CoinGecko API)
- [ ] 🗞️ Telegram/Discord bot that sends daily news summaries
- [ ] 🎙 Turn news into short TTS audio clips
- [ ] 🧠 Train a simple GPT-like model on crypto lingo (optional)

📚 APIs:
- [CryptoPanic](https://cryptopanic.com/developers/api/)
- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

## 💰 Stage 4: Earn or Grow

### 🎯 Goal: Turn your skills into side income or a portfolio

- [ ] Freelance: Build bots or dashboards for crypto creators
- [ ] Apply for internships or web3 hackathons
- [ ] Open-source your tools on GitHub (build your rep)
- [ ] Create a website to show your tools and tutorials
- [ ] Sell access to tools like news dashboards, alerts

---

## 🚀 Tips for the Journey

- Learn by **building**, not just watching videos
- Share your progress (Twitter, GitHub, Discord)
- Stay updated, but don’t follow hype blindly
- Ask questions (Reddit, Stack Overflow, here!)

You're already ahead. Most people just "buy coins" — you're **building** with them. Keep going 💪
